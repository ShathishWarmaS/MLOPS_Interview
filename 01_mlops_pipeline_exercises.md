# MLOps Pipeline Design Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: E-commerce Recommendation System Pipeline

**Scenario**: Design a complete MLOps pipeline for a real-time product recommendation system serving 1M+ users.

### Requirements:
- Real-time inference (<100ms)
- Daily batch training on new data
- A/B testing capabilities
- Model performance monitoring
- Automatic rollback on performance degradation

### Your Task:
1. **Architecture Design**: Draw the complete pipeline architecture
2. **Technology Stack**: Choose appropriate tools and justify your choices
3. **Data Flow**: Explain how data flows from ingestion to serving
4. **Monitoring Strategy**: Define metrics and alerting mechanisms
5. **Deployment Strategy**: Blue-green vs Canary deployment approach

### Expected Components:
```
Data Sources → Feature Store → Training Pipeline → Model Registry → 
Serving Infrastructure → Monitoring & Alerting → Feedback Loop
```

### Questions to Answer:
- How would you handle feature drift?
- What's your strategy for cold start problems?
- How do you ensure data quality?
- What happens if the model serving fails?
