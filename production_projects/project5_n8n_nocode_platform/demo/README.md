# 🎮 n8n MLOps Platform - Interactive Demo

Welcome to the interactive demo of the n8n MLOps Platform! This demo showcases the visual workflow builder capabilities for creating machine learning pipelines.

## 🌟 What You're Seeing

The demo displays a **complete visual workflow builder** with:

### 📋 Left Panel - Node Palette
- **Data Sources**: Load data from files, databases, APIs
- **ML Operations**: Feature engineering, model training, evaluation
- **Deployment**: Model deployment and monitoring nodes

### 🎨 Center Canvas - Workflow Builder  
- **Visual Workflow**: Drag-and-drop interface for building ML pipelines
- **Pre-loaded Sample**: A complete ML training pipeline with 3 connected nodes:
  1. 📊 **Load Training Data** → Database connection
  2. 🔧 **Feature Engineering** → Data transformation
  3. 🧠 **Train XGBoost Model** → Model training

### ⚙️ Right Panel - Properties Editor
- **Node Configuration**: Click any node to edit its properties
- **Dynamic Forms**: Properties change based on node type
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes reflect immediately

### 📊 Bottom Status Bar
- **Workflow Stats**: Live count of nodes and connections
- **Execution Status**: Real-time execution indicator with animations

## 🎮 Interactive Features

### ✨ Try These Actions:

1. **🖱️ Drag & Drop Nodes**
   - Drag any node from the left palette onto the canvas
   - Nodes automatically appear with proper styling and connections

2. **🎯 Select & Configure Nodes**
   - Click on any workflow node to select it (blue border appears)
   - Properties panel updates with node-specific configuration options
   - Edit values like algorithms, hyperparameters, data sources

3. **▶️ Execute Workflow**
   - Click the green "Execute" button in the top toolbar
   - Watch the status indicator animate through execution phases:
     - 🟡 Running: "Loading data..." → "Processing features..." → "Training model..."
     - 🟢 Completed: Shows final status

4. **💾 Save Workflow**
   - Click "Save" button to simulate workflow persistence
   - Status updates to show successful save operation

5. **🔗 Visual Connections**
   - Notice the curved connection lines between nodes
   - Lines automatically redraw when nodes are moved (in full version)
